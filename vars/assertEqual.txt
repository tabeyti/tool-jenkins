An assertion method for testing. Evaluates if the two passed objects are equal. If not, it will throw a Java Exception. Takes an optional error message to display in the exception.

#### Usage:
```groovy
def myString = "pickles"
assertEqual("pickles", myString)
```
```groovy
def myString = "pickles"
assertEqual("pickles", myString, "myString should be pickles!")
```
