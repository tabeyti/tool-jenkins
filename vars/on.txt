Utility step for performing an action "on" one or more targeted nodes. Currently, the only available action is `sh`.

__EXAMPLES:__
```groovy
// In batches of 10, for all small builders, delete this directory
on  regex: 'USCGMW-BLDSM0.*',
    sh: 'rm -rf D:/jenkins/workspace/test',
    batchSize: 10

// For these two builders, checkout and build a repo
on  nodes: ['USCGMW-BUILD157', 'USCGMW-BUILD157'],
    closure: {
        git 'git@somerepo.com'
        sh 'python build.py --config Debug'
    }
    '''
```

### `regex`

Regex of the nodes you want to target. Must either use this property or the `nodes` property.

### `nodes`

Explicit list of node names to target. Must either use this property or the `regex` property.

### `sh`

The shell command to invoke on all the targeted nodes.

### `closure`

A `groovy` closure to invoke on each node.

### `batchSize`

(Optional) Value indicating the batch size for execution (default is everything). A batch itself will be ran in parallel, while each batch will be ran in serial. Used for performance.
