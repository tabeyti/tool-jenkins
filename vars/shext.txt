Extends the `sh` pipeline step, adding retries and retry condition as a part of the arg map.

#### Usage:
```groovy
shext   retries: 3,            // Will retry twice (not including first failed run)
        retryOnStatusCode: 127,
        label: 'Build client',
        script: 'python build.py -a x86_64 -c Debug'
        

```
      


#### `retries`

The number of "attempts" the script execution will make. If 3 is specified, it will re-run __twice__, and only on a failure.


#### `retryOnStatusCode`

The target exit code to retry on. If unspecified, the call will retry on non-zero.
